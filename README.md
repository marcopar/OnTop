An android checklist app that can be shown on top of the lockscreen

This project is made obsolete by recent android developments like widgets on the lockscreen

Anyway it's (or it was) a good example on how to show an activity above the lockscreen with the help of a service and few tricks learned

Much inspiration comes from the project mylockforandroid available at:
